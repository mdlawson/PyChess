# PyChess
This is an ongoing little project made by two people who wanted to learn python better. It currently allows two people to play a game of chess, supporting all typical chess notations as input. It performs legality checks for all moves, and allows all legal chess plays. Check, checkmate, and stalemate supported fully, and identified by the program. The codebase is also reasonably compact, given that neither of us really knows what we are doing, and relatively easy to maintain.
